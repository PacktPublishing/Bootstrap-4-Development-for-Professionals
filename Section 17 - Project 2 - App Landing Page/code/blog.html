          <h1 class="blog-single__h1">Imagination is more important than knowledge.</h1>
          <p class="blog-single__p">Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest.  Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood.</p>
          <p class="blog-single__p">One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother as it had been awhile since they'd seen each other.</p>
          <p class="blog-single__p">"That's a good idea," her mother said.  So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother.</p>
          <p class="blog-single__p">When the basket was ready, the little girl put on her red cloak and kissed her mother goodbye.</p>
          <p class="blog-single__p">"Remember, go straight to Grandma's house," her mother cautioned.  "Don't dawdle along the way and please don't talk to strangers!  The woods are dangerous."</p>
          <p class="blog-single__p">"Don't worry, mommy," said Little Red Riding Hood, "I'll be careful."</p>
          <p class="blog-single__p">But when Little Red Riding Hood noticed some lovely flowers in the woods, she forgot her promise to her mother.  She picked a few, watched the butterflies flit about for awhile, listened to the frogs croaking and then picked a few more. </p>
          <p class="blog-single__p">Little Red Riding Hood was enjoying the warm summer day so much, that she didn't notice a dark shadow approaching out of the forest behind her...</p>
          <p class="blog-single__p">Suddenly, the wolf appeared beside her.</p>
          <p class="blog-single__p">To be Continued...</p>
